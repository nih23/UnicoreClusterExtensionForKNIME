# Unicore Cluster Extension for KNIME

This extension enables KNIME 3.2 and newer to execute (sub-)workflows remotely on cluster systems with Unicore and Unity. Hereby, a single subworkflow can be executed remotely. In case of data-parallel workflows it is also possible to split input to the workflow into several non-overlapping chunks with each chunk being submitted as seperate job to unicores job queue.
